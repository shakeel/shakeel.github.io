### PROJECTS

#### Software Defined Networking SDN Switch — Dept of Energy, Microgrid Resiliency Project at ABB Corporate Research

Built a physical SDN switch using Linux, Intel 4-port NIC PCIe Card, Linux Kernel Modules, Hugepages, VFIO-PCI, Open vSwitch, Intel DPDK, Faucet SDN, Prometheus & Grafana. 

The SDN switch allows us to detect malfunctioning microgrids and isolate them using distributed Power Grid State Estimation algorithms.

This project helped me understand low level Linux Kernel Modules, Open Flow, Networking Namespaces, VLANs, TUN devices, Bridges, Gateways & Routers. Experimented with some off the shelf SDN switches, P4 Language & P4 Runtime. https://micro-grid.github.io/swtch/
